                    One fine, Saturday morning I happened to be particularly bored, and came

                        event’s queue. And then if you hook up TxtyJukebox to a TV you’ll be able to jam to videos on a big screen with big room sound.

                        The driving force behind this application was ACCESSABILITY. Everywhere you turn

                        to communicate so I chose it as the mudium to build the app around.

                    SMS along with a “webhook” from Twillio to the webapp to recieve messages. In addition, it is
                    leveraging the YouTube API to search and load videos which are then loaded into an iframe.

                    <h2>All your fantasy sports info in one place</h2>
                    <p>
                        Last summer I had the chance to work alongside a couple of engineers to build out a
                        site called Rotorobot.com. The idea behind the site was to create a way for people to
                        quickly and efficiently create winning daily fantasy sports lineups. The site was about
                        more than just bombarding users with stats and graphs. The goal was to use our software
                        engineering skills to give people an actual chance against the sharks.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 1) Feed The Machine</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first job was to work on the backend portion of the site and write PHP scripts that could
                        be attached to some Cron Jobs in order to keep our database up to date with the latest
                        fantasy sports information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working with so muchdata was an incredible experience because it introduced me to the ideas
                        that go into databse modeling, and how paring data the right way can greatly simplify
                        creating useful relationships between your data down the road.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 2) Crunch The Numbers</h3>
                    <p>
                        After realizing how much data we had available we decided that it was time to see what we could
                        do with it. Another engineer and myself built a Nodejs backend that housed a lineup optimizer which
                        would let you create lineups optimized on specific metrics for any given date (past or present).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 3) Make It Responsive</h3>
                    <p>
                        The second job that I was tasked with was creating an interactive lineup builder that would
                        allow users to test lineup combinations that adhered to Fanduel rules and regulations. Having
                        spent the earlier part of the summer writing unit tests for a large scale Angular JS project,
                        I figured I would put my new found logic to good use and implement the lineup builder with
                        Angular Js.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After the lineup builder was built the Nodejs backend was incorporated into it, allowing users to create
                        optimized lineups on the metrics of their choice. In addition, we gave users the abiltiy to partially
                        fill a lineup with specifc players and then fill out the remainder of the lineup with optimal choices.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 4) Simplicity is Key</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recently I created a free lineup service for the site that would integrate directly into the Nodejs Server.
                        Users can sign up to recieve daily lineup emails that will contain an optimized lineup for the current night's DFS
                        contests.  Whether you're a new player starting out or someone that jsut wants a little bit of help getting
                        started this service is a simple way to get yourself in the game.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    For the past couple of weeks I have been working with one of the senior engineers on a project called
                    Rotorobot-Fx. We're trying to create an internal development environment so people can interact directly
                    with our data to develop their own algorithms for daily fantasy sports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The image above is for one of the wroking protoypes that I've created so far. In order to give the prototype
                    a natural look and feel I replicated the CSS available for the open source Atom text editor and implemented
                    the interactive functionality by packaging it up with Angularjs. The Code is being handled by a custom AngularJs
                    Codemirror directive. In order to make the protoype useable the front and backend are being wired together using
                    a websocket as the standard http request resonse structure would be much too slow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still prototyping, but will hopefully have a demo working in a bit!

                    <h2>Public Speaking For All</h2>
                    <p>
                        After taking the time to familiarize myself with the Symfony2 web framework I was given my first client project Pspeak.com.
                        It was a patform to help individuals with their public speaking woes. It was in need of some serious front end loving and
                        I was the guy for the job. The front end of the site was built primarily using Bootstrap, jQuery, and LESS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working  on the front end helped me improve my skills using the bootstrap framework, but more improtantly than that it helped
                        me improve my concept of web page layout.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the front end work I was tasked with updating backend code to handle pricing and making some improvements
                        to their sytem that handled cycling coupon codes for users.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="texty-writing-content">
                    <h2>Communication is Key</h2>
                    <p>
                        In building the site I had the opportunity to work alongside both designers and engineers. It was an incredibly rewarding
                        experince that taught me a lot about working in a team setting, and effectivley communicating with all members of a cross
                        functional team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's very easy to forget that not everyone is an engineer and knows the differnence between DOM manipulation using JQuery
                        and a CSS transition. When working on a team being able to ask the right questions and help someone understand the technical solutions that you are
                        implementing to bring their ideas to frution is just as, if not more important, than writing the code itself.

                    <h2>Structure is Important</h2>
                    <p>
                        After working on Pspeak I was tasked with building out a brochure site for one of our clients
                        CVET, a software company that acts a s a platform for quantifying the goods and services being offered
                        by businesses. The site was in need of some serious structure, and needed to be built in a way that would allow
                        for additional content to be added painlessly in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to give the site some structure I decided to switch it over to the Sillex web framework.  I chose Sillex
                        becuse it was a PHP based micro-frame work made up of Symfony components so any one of the other engineers in the
                        office could easily make upates if need be. I decided that becuse the site was only static content, and didn't
                        require and ORM or any way to connect to a database that the full blown Symfony2 framework would require too much
                        overhead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the structural changes I added some updates to make the site more mobile responsive.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Recently I've been looking for a change, and decided to put myself through the dreaded job hunt.
                        On one of my more recent interviews, an interview for a full stack engineering positon at a company located in
                        San francisco, I was asked to complete a challenge problem with a deadline to show off my coding chops.
                        Having already passed the prelim, "yes you know what code is" phone screening I was excited to be able to build
                        something without the stress of someone watching what I was typing or writing on a whiteboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was tasked with building an application that would allow individuals to search for Twitter Users, display
                        their most recent tweets, and to allow the filtering of said tweets by their number of retweets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to implement a single page application by connecting an Angularjs fornt end with a Nodejs backend. I
                        really wanted my project to stand out from the rest so I added additional functionality to it. I used a debounce
                        factory service to implement an autocomplete search feature and added a 3-dimensional, mobile responsive Angular
                        carousel to display a users tweets.
                    </p>
                    <div class="fx-pic">
                        <img src="/public/images/carousel.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <h3>Don't forget the fundies.</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I was finally finished the project was put up on an Amazon ec2 instance, and I waited for for the praise I was
                        sure I would recieve. Unfortunately, having focused so much time and energy on the looks and functionality of the
                        challenge I failed to see the real goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was rushing so much that I missed the fundamentals. The overall structure of my application was non-existent, and I
                        failed to use clearly defined models to structure my data. As you probably know by this point I didnt get the job haha.
                        However it was already up on an ec2 instance that only costs me 60 cents a month so I figured that it was worth it to just
                        leave it up rather than let it fade into oblivon in a cold Git repository.
