                    One fine, Saturday morning I happened to be particularly bored, and came
                    across a sprite sheet for the game Frogger. Since this was one of my
                    favorite games to play as a kid I decided to recreate it using javascript and the
                    HTML5 canvas. If you're bored click inside and give it a whirl!

                        The problem is everyone wants to jam to something different and you’re not thrilled to sit by your laptop all

                        TxtyJukebox lets you setup an event which creates you a unique number which users can text in song requests to.
                        As TxtyJukebox receives song requests, it searches YouTube for music videos and then places the videos into your
                        event’s queue. And then if you hook up TxtyJukebox to a TV you’ll be able to jam to videos on a big screen with big room sound.

                        The driving force behind this application was ACCESSABILITY. Everywhere you turn

                        I wanted to build something that could be used by everyone seamlessly, and cell phones

                        to communicate so I chose it as the mudium to build my app around.

                    SMS along with a “webhook” from Twillio to the webapp to recieve messages. In addition, it is
                    leveraging the YouTube API to search and load videos which are then loaded into an iframe.

                    A site to aggregate and analyze daily fantasy information.

                    <h2>All your fantasy sports info in one place</h2>
                    <p>
                        Last summer I had the chance to work alongside a couple of engineers to build out a
                        site called Rotorobot.com. The idea behind the site was to create a way for people to
                        quickly and efficiently create winning daily fantasy sports lineups. The site was about
                        more than just bombarding users with stats and graphs. The goal was to use our software
                        engineering skills to give people an actual chance against the sharks.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 1) Feed The Machine</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first job was to work on the backend portion of the site and write PHP scripts that could
                        be attached to some Cron Jobs in order to keep our database up to date with the latest
                        fantasy sports information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working with so muchdata was an incredible experience because it introduced me to the ideas
                        that go into databse modeling, and how paring data the right way can greatly simplify
                        creating useful relationships between your data down the road.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 2) Crunch The Numbers</h3>
                    <p>
                        After realizing how much data we had available we decided that it was time to see what we could
                        do with it. Another engineer and myself built a Nodejs backend that housed a lineup optimizer which
                        would let you create lineups optimized on specific metrics for any given date (past or present).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 3) Make It Responsive</h3>
                    <p>
                        The second job that I was tasked with was creating an interactive lineup builder that would
                        allow users to test lineup combinations that adhered to Fanduel rules and regulations. Having
                        spent the earlier part of the summer writing unit tests for a large scale Angular JS project,
                        I figured I would put my new found logic to good use and implement the lineup builder with
                        Angular Js.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After the lineup builder was built the Nodejs backend was incorporated into it, allowing users to create
                        optimized lineups on the metrics of their choice. In addition, we gave users the abiltiy to partially
                        fill a lineup with specifc players and then fill out the remainder of the lineup with optimal choices.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 4) Simplicity is Key</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recently I created a free lineup service for the site that would integrate directly into the Nodejs Server.
                        Users can sign up to recieve daily lineup emails that will contain an optimized lineup for the current night's DFS
                        contests.  Whether you're a new player starting out or someone that jsut wants a little bit of help getting
                        started this service is a simple way to get yourself in the game.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    For the past couple of weeks I have been working with one of the senior engineers on a project called
                    Rotorobot-Fx. We're trying to create an internal development environment so people can interact directly
                    with our data to develop their own algorithms for daily fantasy sports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The image above is for one of the wroking protoypes that I've created so far. In order to give the prototype
                    a natural look and feel I replicated the CSS available for the open source Atom text editor and implemented
                    the interactive functionality by packaging it up with Angularjs. The Code is being handled by a custom AngularJs
                    Codemirror directive. In order to make the protoype useable the front and backend are being wired together using
                    a websocket as the standard http request resonse structure would be much too slow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still prototyping, but will hopefully have a demo working in a bit!
